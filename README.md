# GPlusLoginDemo

What if I tell you that you can almost double your registration rate by adding just single feature in your Android app?

No no I’m not kidding. It is, in fact, possible.

So which feature I’m talking about here?

Google plus Sign In feature!

Even you have also used this feature in some other apps. It basically allows user to register themselves on an Android app by Google account.

Therefore, I’ve also written an article on [Google Plus Sign In integration](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-google-plus-sign-in-triple-android-app-downloads/) tutorial in order to guide you step by step.

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you’re an entrepreneur with an Android app idea to start your own company and looking for [Android app development company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you develop your app idea, you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
